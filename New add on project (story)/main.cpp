He took a mortal blow to the head causing him to fall down and become unconsious. John starts to panic. He grabs the Sword of *cool name* and runs away. As John was running up the castle stairs a dragon came bursting through the castle walls. John threw the Sword of *cool name* really high into the air. He froze in horror. 3 seconds later the Sword of *cool name* came blade down and peirced into Johns skull and all the way into his stomach. Johns eyes rolled back into his head and he fell down the stairs. King Dawson wakes up and saw Johns body right beside him with the sword still sticking out. King Dawson struggles to reach for the Sword of *cool name*. The dragon flew towards King Dawson and melted him to a crip. The town of *cool name* gets torched in flames. 6 hours later Jason was found but in critical condition. Bort Winstin (A surgical expertese) took Jason to *another cool town name* in his wagon.
